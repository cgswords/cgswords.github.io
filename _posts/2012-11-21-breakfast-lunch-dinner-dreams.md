*by Laura Kean*

You're be coming 'round the mountain 
when you come like the sun 
rising on bowls of coral crunch cereal 
and coffee breathing better life 
into my octopus brain, still cold 
and soggy with milky sighs of sleep. 
Some days I can see you peeking 
'round the grandfather clock pendulum--- 
"here hide and seekers counted 
the seconds between vented fingers"--- 
your shadow oscillating short 
and long, measuring the days 
until I can see you, not just 
your pen ink scribbled shape 
formulated against light's edge.

When you ask me to give you 
ketchup for your chicken fingers 
what stories will pass across the table 
camouflaged by corn syrup and tomato paste? 
Over lunch shall I share songs of swashbuckling, 
adventures, of rubber band binding family 
from friends as we walked the plank 
into Miller fountain, "They threw me in 
on my twenty first birthday, you know." 
Or will my words microwave 
the nuggets of my past-present, 
cauterize the juice from syllables and 
splash abstract onto your corduroy jumper: 
red sheen stain on blue green water waves.

Daughter, I think about you 
even though I do not know the hour 
of your advent. Caffeine buzz constellations 
stare at my computer screen and 
my ears curl around plastic: auricle- 
shells echo saltwater breathing 
in and out with the movement of the 
time, and I think forward to ticking hears, 
a metronome marching beat of 
yellow rubber galoshes in puddle 
oceans and pounding feet on stairways. 
I write you into the seaweed strands of 
my memory; "I dreamed about you 
before you were born," dreamed you 
into glass carpet sky, into sighing sea.
